modules:
  # The modules get terraform-applied in order, with the outputs from each
  # being passed into the inputs to the next. It is up to the module authors to
  # ensure the inputs & outputs match up in such a way that they are mutually
  # compatible.
  # Values that users specify as secrets in the Combinator UI are passed
  # into all modules as environment variables with the convention
  # TF_secretname.
